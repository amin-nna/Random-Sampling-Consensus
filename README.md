# Random-Sampling-Consensus
 Those algorithms will detect the dominant planes in a cloud of 3D points. The dominant plane of a set of 3D points is the plane that contains the largest number of points. A 3D point is contained in a plane if it is located at a distance less than eps (ε) from that plane.
